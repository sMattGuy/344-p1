Thank you for this chance at a better grade, here is what has changed in this version

KioskHelper is now in its own file and a public class, rather than private to each Kiosk.
KioskHelper now doesnt terminate when no voters are in line, only when all voters have been helped

Every other thread and monitor is the same as it was when originally uploaded

I have attached a Git Diff in the file titled "Git Diff of Changes" which shows what code has been changed.

Thank you for everything, if you have any questions you can contact me at
